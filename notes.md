1. IAM users, groups, roles, and policies
    - In an account we have users, groups, roles, and policies
    - we have a group and can assign users to groups and can assign permissions to user (policies)
    - Policies define the permissions for the identities or resources they are associated with.
    - Identitiy-based policies can be applied to users, groups, and roles
    - Users gain permissions applied to the group through a policy
    - Roles are used for delegation and are assumed.
    - Groups:
        - Groups are a collection of users
        - Users can be members of up to 10 groups.
        - Reason to use groups is to apply permissions to users using policies.
    - Roles:
        - IAM role is an IAM identity that has specific permissions
        - Roles are assumed by users, applications, and services.
        - Once assumed, the identity "becomes" the role and gain the roles permissions.
    - Policies:
        - Policies are documents that define permissions and are written in json.
        - All permissions are implicityly DENIED by default.  (You must explicitly allow something)
    - Two types of policies
        - Identity-based policies can be applied to users, groups, and roles.
        - Resource-based policies apply to resources such as s3 buckets or DynamoDB tables.
    - Root user
        - the account with full permissions
    - Regular users
        - up to 5000 individual users can be created
        - They have no permissions by default

2. STS security token service
    - Two pieces to an IAM role:
        - Trust policy:
            - Controls who can assume a specific role.
            - Trust policy should have the following:
                Effect: Allow/Deny
                Principal
                    service: ec2.amazon.com, s3.amazon.com, ebs.amazon.com ect
                Action: "sts:AssumeRole" <-- Here is where STS is called out.
        - Permissions policy
    - Temporary credentials are used with identity federation, delegation, cross-account access and IAM roles
3. IAM Access Control
    - Identity based policies
        - controls actions an identity can perform on resources and under what conditions.
        - Can be attached to a user, group, or role
        - Types
            - aws managed: created and managed by AWS
            - customer managed: customer managed by customers
        - Can be attached to multiple types at once, identity policies could be attached to user, group, and role all at the same time.
    - Resource based policies
        - Attached to resources such as S3 bucket.
        - Resource based policies grant the specified PRINCIPLE(role, user), the PERMISSION, to perform specifix ACTION on RESOURCE.
        - What is meant by video 19, 3:47 related to IAM role with a trust policy and permissions policy.
4. RBAC
    - Role based access control
    - May have groups where we place users of similar types together and place permissions policies to the group.
5. ABAC
    - Attribute based access control
    - Tags could be used for this behavior.  Based on tags you get X permissions.
        - A conditional statement would need to be used that checks for the tags in question.
6. Permissions boundaries
    - Can be applied to USERS and ROLES
    - Adds a layer to your already granted permissions.  If you have access to a dynamodb based on a resource policy, you'd need your permissions boundary to also allow you access to dynamo.  If it wasn't included on the perm boundary you couldn't access it.  It looks like two layers of permissions.  You still need actual permissions to an object, but you also need it added to the boundary as well just stating you can do some specific action.
