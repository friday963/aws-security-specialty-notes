1. IAM users, groups, roles, and policies
    - In an account we have users, groups, roles, and policies
    - we have a group and can assign users to groups and can assign permissions to user (policies)
    - Policies define the permissions for the identities or resources they are associated with.
    - Identitiy-based policies can be applied to users, groups, and roles
    - Users gain permissions applied to the group through a policy
    - Roles are used for delegation and are assumed.
    - Groups:
        - Groups are a collection of users
        - Users can be members of up to 10 groups.
        - Reason to use groups is to apply permissions to users using policies.
    - Roles:
        - IAM role is an IAM identity that has specific permissions
        - Roles are assumed by users, applications, and services.
        - Once assumed, the identity "becomes" the role and gain the roles permissions.
    - Policies:
        - Policies are documents that define permissions and are written in json.
        - All permissions are implicityly DENIED by default.  (You must explicitly allow something)
    - Two types of policies
        - Identity-based policies can be applied to users, groups, and roles.
        - Resource-based policies apply to resources such as s3 buckets or DynamoDB tables.
    - Root user
        - the account with full permissions
    - Regular users
        - up to 5000 individual users can be created
        - They have no permissions by default

2. STS security token service
    - Two pieces to an IAM role:
        - Trust policy:
            - Controls who can assume a specific role.
            - Trust policy should have the following:
                Effect: Allow/Deny
                Principal
                    service: ec2.amazon.com, s3.amazon.com, ebs.amazon.com ect
                Action: "sts:AssumeRole" <-- Here is where STS is called out.
        - Permissions policy
    - Temporary credentials are used with identity federation, delegation, cross-account access and IAM roles
    - IAM roles
